# The C Programming Language (K&R)
Solutions for every exercise from "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan / Ritchie. I wrote a [Medium post (WIP)]() and a [Show HN (WIP)]() about this project.

## Important Note
Other than the stated goals below, code quality may vary wildly in some places - in addition to jumping around a good bit, this was the first "classic CS book" that I read, so as in addition to learning C I also learned how to write code productively and how to read a CS textbook productively.

## Goals
My goals for this textbook changed as I read it. I settled on the following definition for "complete":
- All pages read, including the appendices
- All exercises solved, with maximum const correctness
- All solutions compile against C11 with `-Werror -Wall`
- All solutions report no issues from Clang's static analyzer (`scan-build`), excluding false positives
- All solutions report no memory leaks in `valgrind` when run with `--leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all`

I have _not_ tried to hold to the text as closely as possible at the cost of writing straightforward code; e.g. I may use structs in my solutions in chapter 5 despite them not being introduced til chapter 6.

## Running via Makefile
 its own target (e.g. `make 5.4` will make exercise 4 in chapter 5). `make all` compiles all exercises, and runs some with test input. Some exercises are refactored into their own shared subprograms when warranted; e.g. 5.14 - 5.17 are all about the `sort` program, so they exist in `ch-5/sort/`. Makefile targets exist for these solutions independently.

## Top Highlights
* `ch-8/malloc_j/` - a storage allocator / the final boss of K&R
* `common/trees/` - a generic binary search tree library I wrote to handle exercises in Chapter 6
* `ch-8/fopen_j/` - buffered FILE I/O
* `common/tests/` - a simple unit testing library that wraps around the `assert(3)` macro; I wound up not using this too much beyond ch-1 as my testing stategy evolved.
* [C FAQ](https://github.com/jsgoller1/c-faq) - this is a separate repo I started to help work through questions I had about C as I read K&R.

## Conventions
I have my editor set up to run `clang-format -i --style=Google` on save.

## Notes about the exercises
* Each chapter / subproject has its own README.md; see these for specific notes.
* For programs reading from stdin, it is expected behavior that you will need to hit CTRL-D twice to exit if the last character entered was not a newline - this behavior is defined by the POSIX standard (see this [Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21260674/why-do-i-need-to-type-ctrl-d-twice-to-mark-end-of-file?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=google_rich_qa&utm_campaign=google_rich_qa)).
