/*
 * Ex 1.11: How would you test the 1.5.4 word count program?
 * ---
 * 1) I have rewritten the program so that the code
 * that does the word counting in encapsulated in its own
 * function that is const correct and I/O ignorant. This should
 * isolate bugs to just logical errors in the function.
 * 2) I have written a test case that cover every line of word_count().
 * This ensures that there are no completely untested parts of the program.
 * 3) I have written a few different tests to try to find edge cases that I
 * speculate may cause the program to behave unpredictably.
