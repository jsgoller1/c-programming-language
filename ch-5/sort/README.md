Sort
---

```
 * Exercise 5-14. Modify the sort program to handle a -r flag, which indicates
 * sorting in reverse (decreasing) order. Be sure that -r works with -n.
 *
 * Exercise 5-15. Add the option -f to fold upper and lower case together, so
 * that case distinctions are not made during sorting; for example, a and A
 * compare equal.
 *
 * Exercise 5-16. Add the -d ("directory order") option, which makes
 * comparisons only on letters, numbers and blanks. Make sure it works in
 * conjunction with -f.
 *
 * Exercise 5-17. Add a field-handling capability, so sorting may be done on
 * fields within lines, each field sorted according to an independent set of
 * options. (The index for this book was sorted with -df for the index category
 * and -n for the page numbers.)
