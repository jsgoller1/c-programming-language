// Since K&R talked about alloc already(),
// I'm going to use malloc() here -
// we cannot just append t to the end of s, because
// we don't know if s has enough space for all
// the characters; we could mandate that a third
// array is passed in that does have sufficient capacity,
// but doing this is probably the safest and most concise
// approach.
