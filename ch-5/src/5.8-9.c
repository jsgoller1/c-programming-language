Exercise 5-8. There is no error checking in day_of_year or month_day.
Remedy this defect.

Exercise 5-9. Rewrite the routines day_of _year and month_day with
pointers instead of indexing.

Wikipedia algorithm for determining a leap year:
if (year is not divisible by 4) then (it is a common year)
else if (year is not divisible by 100) then (it is a leap year)
else if (year is not divisible by 400) then (it is a common year)
else (it is a leap year)
