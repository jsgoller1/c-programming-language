# C FAQ
Questions I  had while learning C and experiments I've done to answer them. All FAQs here are strictly about C11; I make no claims about earlier versions of C.

## Use
All programs can be compiled and executed via the Makefile; just run `make <filename without the ".c" suffix>` and the program will compile and automatically execute.

## TODO:
- c11 / -Werror -Wall compliant
- keywords descriptions
- examples and experiments from "C Programming FAQs" by Steve Summit.
