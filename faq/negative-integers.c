// How do negative integers work in C?

int main() {
  /*
  The C spec doesn't designate how negative integers should be stored, but
  typically most arches use the most significant bit of the word to store
  the sign; values with it set are negative, and unset are positive.
  Whenever we see any hex value from 0x80000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF representing a
  signed int, we know they're negative, and any value from 0x00000001 to
  0x7FFFFFFF is positive (zero is not positive or negative but it "counts" as a
  positive integer, which we will revisit at the end).

  With this convention, we use the "two's complement" procedure to derive a
  negative int from a positive one. The two's complement can be calculated by
  flipping all bits and adding one. Take the integer 8 on a 32-bit machine as an
  example: 
  8 = 0x00000008:        0b0000...1000. 
  Flip all bits:         0b1111...0111 (0xFFFFFFF7) 
  Add 1 (0b0000...0001): 0b1111...1000 (0xFFFFFFF8)
  */
  printf(" 0x8: %4x\n-0x8: %4x\n", 8, -8);

  /*
  Another example:
  351 on a 32-bit machine.
  351 = 0x0000015f = 0b0000....0001 0101 1111
  Flip bits:         0b1111....1110 1010 0000
  Add one:           0b1111....1110 1010 0001
  Hex:               0xFFFFF    E    A    1
  */
  printf(" 351: %4x\n-351: %4x\n", 351, -351);

  /*
  What if we want to go from a negative integer to a positive? Same procedure.
  -754: =             0xFFFFF    D     0   E 
  Binary              0b1111....1101 0000 1110
  Flip all bits:      0b0000....0010 1111 0001
  Add one:            0b0000....0010 1111 0010
  Hex:                0x00000    2    F    2

  What if we want to go back to the negative? Can "flip, add one" be applied
  repeatedly? 
  754:                0x00000    2    F    2 
  Binary:             0b0000....0010 1111 0010 
  Flip all bits:      0b1111....1101 0000 1101 
  Add one:            0b1111....1101 0000 1110 
  Hex:                0xFFFFF    D    0    E

  Note that this is the value we started with.

  Armed with this knowledge, we can now as an important question: what is the
  biggest possible positive integer, and least possible negative integer? Let's
  calculate it. My current machine (2017 Macbook Pro w/ Intel Core i7) has a
  32bit address space, which can be determined with WORD_BIT from limits.h

  /*
  Recall from before that most arches use the most significant bit of the word
  to store the sign; values with it set are negative, and unset are positive.
  With this in mind, 0x7FFFFFFF is the greatest possible positive value, but
  what represents the least possible negative value - 0x80000000 or 0xFFFFFFFF?

  Well, let's think about our range of positive integers - the negative version
  of the greatest positive integer will almost certainly give us the least
  negative integer, and the negative version of the least positive integer will
  give us the greatest negative integer. Flipping all bits for 0x00000001 gives
  us 0xFFFFFFFE, and then adding 1 gives us 0xFFFFFFFF - so we can hazard a
  guess that 0x80000000 is less than 0xFFFFFFFF. But there's an interesting
  issue here - two's complement of the greatest possible positive integer,
  0x7FFFFFFF is 0x80000001 (flipping all bits is 0x80000000, then add 1 to get
  0x80000001), not 0x80000000. What gives? If two's complement is the binary
  equivalent of multiplying a decimal integer by -1, why does performing this
  operation on the greatest positive integer _not_ give us the least negative
  one?

  Remember above that I said zero "counts" as a positive integer. If you pair
  up all all of the positive values in a 32-bit address space with their
  negative values - (0x0xFFFFFFFF, 0x00000001), (0xFFFFFFFE, 0x00000002),
  (0xFFFFFFFD, 0x00000003), and so on - you wind up with two values left in the
  address space: 0x00000000 and 0x800000000. 0x00000000 is zero, but since
  there's no such thing as "negative zero", we simply go on to the next possible
  negative value after 0x800000001 - as such, we have one more negative value
  than positive values.

  So, to find the least negative value, set the sign bit and no other bits; to
  find the greatest positive value, set all other bits except for the sign bit.

  To double check, you can use the following constants from <limits.h> to see
  your architecture's various max and min values for different types:

  CHAR_BIT    |   Number of bits in the smallest variable that is not a bit
  field. SCHAR_MIN   |   Minimum value for a variable of type signed char.
  SCHAR_MAX   |   Maximum value for a variable of type signed char.
  UCHAR_MAX   |   Maximum value for a variable of type unsigned char.
  CHAR_MIN    |   Minimum value for a variable of type char.
  CHAR_MAX    |   Maximum value for a variable of type char.
  MB_LEN_MAX  |   Maximum number of bytes in a multicharacter constant.
  SHRT_MIN    |   Minimum value for a variable of type short.
  SHRT_MAX    |   Maximum value for a variable of type short.
  USHRT_MAX   |   Maximum value for a variable of type unsigned short.
  INT_MIN     |   Minimum value for a variable of type int.
  INT_MAX     |   Maximum value for a variable of type int.
  UINT_MAX    |   Maximum value for a variable of type unsigned int.
  LONG_MIN    |   Minimum value for a variable of type long.
  LONG_MAX    |   Maximum value for a variable of type long.
  ULONG_MAX   |   Maximum value for a variable of type unsigned long.
